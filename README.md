TouchStadia is a Chrome Extension which adds on-screen joystick control to Stadia for touchscreen devices!

## Demo
[![Demo video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/AmnuVkkQBu4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmnuVkkQBu4)

## Usage
Simply install the extension and open or refresh Stadia! Click the extension icon to show configuration options.

TEMPORARY NOTE: Setting layouts with <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> is available in `0.0.24`, which is not yet on the Chrome Web Store.

To move buttons around, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> in Stadia and layout mode will be activated (indicated by a magenta background.) Tap/click and drag buttons to change their positions during this time. Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> again to disable layout mode. This hotkey will not work when Stadia is in-game. This is a [known issue](https://github.com/ihatecsv/TouchStadia/issues/9), so to ensure function please only use this shortcut outside of games for now.

Keep in mind that once you change the position of a button in layout mode, that button will no longer move relative to the window border when resizing your browser, so you must maintain the same browser window size for the layout to look consistent. If you create a layout, then shrink your browser, it's possible to lose buttons outside the visible area! To reset the layout, press the `Reset` button in the TouchStadia configuration.

## Testing
TouchStadia also has manifest permissions to run on [html5gamepad.com](https://html5gamepad.com), where you can test the input of the controller with visual feedback! This is useful if you'd rather not wait for a game to open!

## Regarding mobile devices
As of right now, [sigmaxipi/chromium-for-stadia](https://github.com/sigmaxipi/chromium-for-stadia) is the only way to play Stadia on Android, aside from the native application. Unfortunately, Chrome/Chromium for Android does not support extensions. I'm looking into a way to integrate TouchStadia into a custom build of Chromium so it can be used on mobile devices. There may also be other ways to accomplish this. If you have leads on how to go about doing this, please feel free to comment in [this issue!](https://github.com/ihatecsv/TouchStadia/issues/2)

## Pull requests
